                        <h1>My Story</h1>
                        <p>Actress Gal Gadot first attracted notice as the winner of the Miss Israel competition in 2004. After undertaking two years of military service, she studied law before pursuing acting opportunities. Fast & Furious (2009), the fourth installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise, was her first film role. Gadot was eventually tapped to play the DC Comics superhero Wonder Woman on screen, earning praise for her leading performance in the 2017 box-office hit Wonder Woman.</p>

                            Gadot was born on April 30, 1985, in Rosh HaAyin, Israel. Her father worked as an engineer and her mother was a teacher. Gadot was an athletic child, studying dance and playing several sports in her youth. One of her first career ambitions was to be a choreographer, she told Vanity Fair.

                            Gadot entered the Miss Israel competition at age 18, thinking it would be a fun experience. “I never thought I would win,” she explained to Glamour magazine. “I was shocked when they crowned me.” This victory helped launch her career as a model. Gadot then served her mandatory two-year commitment in the Israel Defense Forces, before heading to college to study law.

                            While in college, Gadot was asked to audition to play the love interest of super spy James Bond in Quantum of Solace (2008). She had several callbacks, but she didn’t get the part. Still, the experience sparked her interest in acting. As Gadot told Interview magazine, “I realized it takes a lot to act, and it's so much more interesting than going to law school.” She soon landed a role on the Israeli TV series Bubot.
